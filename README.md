LEARNING WITH PACE: A fun and interactive web-app utilising the data provided by NASA's PACE satellite. For the PACE in Classroom challenge, our goal is to integrate this real-world Earth science data into classrooms to bridge the gap between scientific research and classroom learning, helping students and teachers understand ocean ecosystems, atmospheric processes, and climate change. In our approach, we have familiarized ourself with data from PACE then classified, and divided it into different age groups (8-11, 12-16, 16+).
